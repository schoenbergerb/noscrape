## project goal

this projects goal is to provide an infrastructure to create an obfuscated font (public-key) and a lookup json (private key) 
to prevent anyone to scrape content from your obfuscated html output.

## _IMPORTANT NOTE_

Bots are not longer able to process obfuscated text or it comes to unpredictable analytics results etc. 
<br>
So please beware of using this technique on relevant content for indexed pages!
